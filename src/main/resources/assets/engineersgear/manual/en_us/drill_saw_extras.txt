<&meatgrinder_recipe> The §2Meatgrinder Blade§r is not intended for use on the environment, but is designed to cut through living (or undead) creatures. It deals more damage than other blades, and will harvest additional resources similar to the §2Looting§r enchantment.<np>
<&rotors_recipe> The §2Precision Rotors§r are an upgrade to the <link;mining_drill;Mining Drill;start> that allow it to harvest blocks as though enchanted with §2Silktouch§r.
